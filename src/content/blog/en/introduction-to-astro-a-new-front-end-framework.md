Astro is a modern front-end framework that provides developers with a faster way to build websites. It brings about an interesting paradigm shift in how we think about building modern web applications. 

## What is Astro?

Astro is a new type of JavaScript-based static site generator. Unlike other popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, Astro does not send any JavaScript by default. Instead, Astro only sends HTML, CSS, and as little JavaScript as you need. This results in faster load times and better performance for your web apps.

Astro is built to take advantage of modern browser features, like HTTP/2 and server components. This allows you to build highly interactive sites, without the typical cost associated with sending large JavaScript bundles to the client.


## Key Features of Astro


### No JavaScript Sent By Default

By default, Astro sends no JavaScript to the client. This makes your site fast out of the box. However, you're not restricted to this. You can add as much JavaScript as you want or need.


### Use Your Favorite JavaScript Framework

One of the key strengths of Astro is its ability to work with multiple JavaScript frameworks. You can use components from React, Vue, Svelte, and others within the same project. This allows you to choose the best tool for the job, without being tied to a specific technology.


### SEO Friendly

Astro's output is just HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript, making it perfect for search engine optimization (SEO). You can even prerender your pages, providing a fast initial load and excellent search engine discoverability.
